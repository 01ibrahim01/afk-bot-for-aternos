# aternos-afkbot
Hi, this is a aternos bot which stays afk in your minecraft server.

First of all you need to change the ip in [config file](https://github.com/krushna06/afk-bot-for-aternos/blob/main/config.json).
```
{
	"ip":"yourip.aternos.me",
	"port": "25565",

}

```
Then you need to clone this bot to [Replit](https://replit.com/~)
